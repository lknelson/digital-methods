    "* Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",

    "* Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the rest of the course, often we will use a function definition to explain a concept. Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as \"find the smallest value in a list of values\". Later we will show you code that finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as a function named min which takes a list of values as its argument and returns the smallest value in the list."
