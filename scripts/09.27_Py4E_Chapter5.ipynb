    "\n",
    "* Understand iteration in Python, and how the `for` loop works.\n",

    "## For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a for loop? It is simply a series of instructions, or things to do, that you want to do on multiple elements. It's a way to do the same thing over and over, with different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, on Halloween, if you live in a house, you probably have a bowl of candy sitting near your front door. During the evening, for every child that comes to your door you do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Say \"Happy Halloween\"\n",
    "* Ask them what they are dressed as\n",
    "* Give them a piece of candy\n",
    "* Cackle wildly\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a for loop! We use similar sytax in Python. In our example for every child that comes to your door, do the following. In Python, we say for every element in a list, do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a for loop, we have to assign each element of the list to the same variable name (decided by us), and then we use that variable name in our set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of a for loop is similar to the way we defined a function. We have a line that start with for, followed by a colon, then the next lines within the for loop are indented. When we are done writing the instructions for the for loop, we no longer indent the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: let's assign a list of strings to the variable `trickotreaters`. We will then carry out our above list of instructions for each child. Note the syntax here."
